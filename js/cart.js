/**
 * js/cart.js
 * This file previously managed localStorage-based cart logic.
 * With the introduction of API-based cart management handled by js/cart-page.js,
 * this file is now largely obsolete.
 *
 * Most of its functions (loadCartData, renderCart, updateQuantity, removeFromCart, etc.)
 * are no longer needed as their responsibilities are covered by js/cart-page.js
 * using API calls.
 *
 * Global utilities like updateCartCount and showToast are now in js/main.js.
 * Dark mode and mobile menu are also handled globally by js/main.js.
 *
 * This file is kept to ensure `cart.html`'s script tag doesn't break,
 * but it will not perform any localStorage cart operations.
 * It could be removed entirely if the script tag in cart.html is also removed.

  // The following functions are examples of what was here and is now handled elsewhere or deprecated:
  // initElements() - DOM elements are now primarily managed by js/cart-page.js
  // initDarkMode() - Handled by js/main.js
  // updateDarkModeIcon() - Handled by js/main.js
  // setupEventListeners() - Specific cart item event listeners are in js/cart-page.js
  // loadCartData() - Deprecated (localStorage)
  // renderCart() - Handled by js/cart-page.js with API data
  // showEmptyCart() - Handled by js/cart-page.js
  // updateCartTotal() - Handled by js/cart-page.js
  // updateQuantity() - Deprecated (localStorage) -> API call in js/cart-page.js
  // removeFromCart() - Deprecated (localStorage) -> API call in js/cart-page.js
  // updateCartCount() - Handled by js/main.js (API based)
  // showToast() - Handled by js/main.js

  // Any specific, non-cart related UI logic for cart.html that is not in js/cart-page.js
  // and not covered by js/main.js could remain here, but it's unlikely.
